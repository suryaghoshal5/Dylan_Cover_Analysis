Build a full pipeline to analyze Bob Dylanâ€™s songs and their cover versions across time and platforms. The goal is to:
- Identify all Dylan originals using MusicBrainz
- Collect all cover versions with artist metadata
- Enrich songs with Spotify popularity data
- Build a knowledge graph connecting originals to covers
- Explore cultural influence and musical networks

### 1. `get_dylan_songs.py`
Fetches all original Bob Dylan works from MusicBrainz.
- Fields captured: `work_id`, `title`, `type`, `language`, `aliases`, `relations`, `attributes`

### 2. `get_covers.py`
Fetches all known recordings and releases linked to each Dylan work.
- Fields: `recording_id`, `title`, `artist_name`, `release_title`, `release_id`, `first-release-date`
- Saves data to: `data/recordings.csv`

### 3. `get_spotify_data.py`
Enriches each cover with Spotify metadata and popularity.
- Adds: `spotify_track_id`, `popularity`, `album_name`, `release_date`, `duration_ms`, `explicit`
- Saves to: `data/recordings_spotify_enriched.csv`

### 4. `build_graph_db.py`
Builds a song â†’ artist network graph using `pyvis`.
- Nodes: Songs and Artists
- Edges: Covers with popularity weights
- Output: `output/dylan_cover_graph.html`

### 5. `get_live_counts.py` (Optional)
Adds live performance frequency from Setlist.fm or cached data.
